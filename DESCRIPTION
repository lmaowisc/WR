Description: Implements various win ratio methodologies for composite endpoints of death and 
  non-fatal events, including the (stratified) proportional win-fractions (PW) regression models 
  (Mao and Wang, 2020 <doi:10.1111/biom.13382>), (stratified) two-sample tests with possibly 
  recurrent nonfatal event, and sample size calculation for standard win ratio test (Mao et al., 
  2021 <doi:10.1111/biom.13501>).
