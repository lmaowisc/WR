# WR

The **WR** package implements various win ratio methodologies for
composite endpoints of death and non-fatal events, including the
(stratified) proportional win-fractions (PW) regression models (Mao and
Wang, 2020 <doi:10.1111/biom.13382>), (stratified) two-sample tests with
possibly recurrent nonfatal event, and sample size calculation for
standard win ratio test (Mao et al., 2021 <doi:10.1111/biom.13501>).

## Installation

Install **WR** from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("WR")

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
